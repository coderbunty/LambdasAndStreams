We use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods.
Sometimes, however, a lambda expression does nothing but call an existing method.
(receives the value & passes it as it is to the method as parameters)
In these cases, it's often clearer to refer to the existing method by name.

Method references enable us to do this; they are compact, easy-to-read lambda expressions
for methods that already have a name.

// numbers is a collection of Integers
numbers.foreach(val -> System.out.println(val))
numbers.foreach(System.out::println)    // using method reference in place of lambda expression

Syntax:
Class::methodName       // static or instance method
object::methodName
